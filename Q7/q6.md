## Jump Window

I needed to familiarize myself with the ui system and client modding side of otclient for this one. I used the otclient from edubart.

After doing some research, I found that the way to achieve the window shown in the video would be through client modules. Though documentation on the implementation of GUI classes were pretty lacking, I was able to find some useful information about the classes from the site at: https://wizniz.net/doc/otclient/index.html

Using that, I was able to figure out how to use the g_dispatcher, as well as the g_ui/widget classes to achieve the moving jump button. It was a pretty interesting challenge overall and I really enjoyed the satisfaction of finally getting everything to work how I wanted it to. If you would like to try the window for yourself, simply copy the entire jump folder into the /mods/ folder of the client and load it through the modules window.
