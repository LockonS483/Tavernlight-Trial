## Frigid Winter

Frigid Winter seems like an appropriate name

My implementation was originally going to be generating random areas and using addEvent to execute combat over multiple waves; however, after some experimentation, randomly generating and using createArea does not seem to work in runtime.

Instead, after doing some research, it seems that a possibility to recreate an effect like that would be to simply not add the effect to the combat and to handle the animations myself using the sendMagicEffect interface. To do this, I parse through a predefined area (a simple 3x3 diamond around the player) to generate a table of offsets. Then, using the caster's position, we randomly choose batches of offsets from our table and send the effects with a batch-based delay to our animation handler using addEvent.

This felt like a relatively elegant solution that has plenty of room for reuse on similar spells as well.
